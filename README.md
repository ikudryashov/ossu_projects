# ossu_projects
I will be using this repo to store some of the homeworks and final projects (where applicable) for the OSSU Computer Science courses I've taken.

## Current Progress
- [x] [How to Code: Simple Data](#UBC-How-to-Code-Simple-Data)
- [x] [How to Code: Complex Data](#UBC-How-to-Code-Complex-Data)
- [ ] [Programming Languages: Part A](#University-of-Washington-Programming-Languages-Part-A)

## [UBC How to Code: Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-simple-data)
The final project for this course is a Space Invaders game clone made with Racket. Check out the code [here](UBC%20HtC1x%20How%20to%20Code%20-%20Simple%20Data%20/space-invaders.rkt).

## [UBC How to Code: Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data)
There was no final project in this course.

## [University of Washington: Programming Languages: Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)
Will be uploading homework files as it appears that this course does not have a final project. They can be found [here](Programming%20Languages%20-%20Part%20A/Homeworks).
